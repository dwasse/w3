# w3

`w3` is your toolbelt for integrating with Ethereum in Go. Closely linked to `goâ€‘ethereum`, it provides an ergonomic wrapper for working with **RPC**, **ABI's**, and the **EVM**.


```
go get github.com/lmittmann/w3
```


## At a Glance

* Use [`w3.Client`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/lmittmann/w3#Client) to connect to an RPC endpoint. The client features batch request support for up to **80x faster requests** and easy extendibility.
* Use [`w3vm.VM`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/lmittmann/w3/w3vm#VM) to simulate EVM execution with optional tracing and Mainnet state forking, or test Smart Contracts.
* Use [`w3.Func`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/lmittmann/w3#Func) and [`w3.Event`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/lmittmann/w3#Event) to create ABI bindings from Solidity function and event signatures.
* Use [`w3.A`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/lmittmann/w3#A), [`w3.H`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/lmittmann/w3#H), and many other utility functions to parse addresses, hashes, and other common types from strings.
